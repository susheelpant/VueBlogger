I am nobody, or maybe someone too ordinary, whom you meet or ignore everyday while walking on that street. 

I was trying to figure things out and finding answers to everything, even to every nonsense stuff. And in finding those, I lost myself. <strong>Lately and fortunately, I found myself back, as a being and as part of everything, still an individual being.</strong> Now that I understood that understanding everything is not important. There are logics behind everything that happens, but its not important for me to understand all that. <strong>Just like our eyes cannot see everything and ears cannot hear all the sounds, they work under a limit and a range. Same way, our mind could not comprehend everything that happens around.</strong> Leave the logics and reasons. 

For long, I have stopped finding answers to all the Whys and Hows, for everything less concerning. Because, answer to the biggest Why I will never be able to find out anyways - "Why did i come here - purpose of my life on earth?"
